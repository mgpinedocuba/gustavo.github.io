        This manual is a basic guide for operating the magnetron sputtering 
        system in the laboratory of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San 
        Marcos (UNMSM). It provides a step-by-step explanation of the process 
        for preparing thin films, along with descriptions of the system's 
        components and procedures. This manual is still under development, 
        so I would greatly appreciate any additional information or feedback 
        you may have, especially regarding errors or missing details.

      <h2>General description of the equipment</h2>

      <p class="textformat">
        The equipment used is a magnetron sputtering system, model ATC Polaris 
        from AJA International, located in the Faculty of Physical Sciences at 
        the Centre for Technological, Biomedical, and Environmental Research 
        (CITBM). This system supports the integration of various accessories 
        and modules. However, the components described below are those that 
        were present in the system at the time these notes were written. These 
        components include:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="textformat">
        The high-vacuum chamber is monitored using a high/low vacuum detector, which provides 
        real-time pressure readings inside the chamber. Accurate interpretation of these readings 
        requires reference to standardized pressure scales, as the system operates within both 
        low- and high-vacuum ranges. Vacuum generation is achieved through the combined use of 
        a mechanical pump and a turbomolecular pump. The mechanical pump reduces the chamber 
        pressure to the low-vacuum range, after which the turbomolecular pump further lowers it 
        to reach high-vacuum conditions. Additionally, the system includes a break-vacuum 
        mechanism consisting of a nitrogen gas line connected to the main chamber. This allows 
        the vacuum to be safely broken using nitrogen instead of ambient air, preventing the 
        introduction of moisture and enabling faster pump-down cycles.
      </p>
      <p class="textformat">
        The equipment is equipped with a gas flow control system that allows the introduction of
        up to four different gases. At the time of writing these notes, only the argon gas line is
        operational. These gases are used to generate the plasma required for the sputtering
        process. The following key components are the magnetrons, where the targets are
        mounted. Plasma is generated and confined by the magnetic fields produced within the
        magnetrons. The system is designed to accommodate up to five magnetrons; however,
        only four are currently in use. The equipment includes both RF and DC power sources,
        which are responsible for supplying the electrical energy necessary to excite the plasma
        and accelerate ions toward the target. Since the deposition rate is dependent on chamber
        pressure, it is desirable to lower the pressure to a level that supports stable plasma
        formation. This pressure reduction can be achieved either by decreasing the argon flow
        or by reducing the pumping speed. In the current system configuration, the latter approach
        is used; argon flow is kept constant while the connection between the chamber and the
        vacuum pumps is partially closed until the desired pressure is reached.
      </p>
      <p class="textformat">
        In addition, a quartz crystal microbalance is used to calibrate the deposition rate for each
        material, based on the material’s density and its corresponding Z-factor. The operation of
        the microbalance relies on the piezoelectric effect: the quartz crystal vibrates at a specific
        resonance frequency, which decreases proportionally as mass is deposited onto its
        surface. By measuring changes in frequency, the amount of deposited mass can be
        determined. Knowing the mass accumulated over a given period allows for the calculation
        of the deposition rate onto the substrate. The system also includes shutters, which are
        controlled via the gas-flow control panel. These shutters are actuated by compressed air
        supplied through the rear of the equipment. Substrates are mounted on a holder that can
        be rotated at variable speeds, and the distance between the substrate holder and the
        magnetrons can be adjusted to optimize deposition conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Typical procedures to control the equipment</h2>

      <h3>Break the vacuum and open the chamber</h3>

      <p class="textformat">
        This procedure is intended either for cleaning the interior of the main chamber or for
        removing a prepared sample. To open the main chamber under high-vacuum conditions,
        the following steps must be followed. First, it is essential to check the barometer to ensure
        that the chamber is indeed under high vacuum. Currently, nitrogen is used to break the
        vacuum; therefore, it is important to verify that the pressure indicated on the nitrogen
        cylinder manometer is at the correct level (typically around 5 psi).
      </p>
      <ol class="textformat">
        <li>
          First, the turbomolecular pump is turned off by pressing the lower-right button on
          the control panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Immediately after turning off the turbomolecular pump, slightly open the nitrogen
          stopcock to allow nitrogen to enter and help break the vacuum in the pump. Make 
          sure the nitrogen gas valve is open.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, wait until the turbomolecular pump’s frequency reaches low values, typically 
          around 50 to 100 Hz, before switching off the mechanical pump power supply.
        </li>
        <li>
          The chamber latch must be released to prevent over-pressurization of the chamber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slowly open the vacuum break valve of the main chamber to allow nitrogen to
          enter and monitor the pressure until it reaches approximately 754 torr.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the pressure reaches ambient levels, close the air valve and open the
          chamber door. Ensure that the nitrogen stopcock is also closed.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Produce a high vacuum in the main chamber</h3>

      <p>
        To ensure proper thin film deposition, it is necessary to achieve a high vacuum to maintain
        a clean environment and enable stable plasma generation. The following steps are
        therefore carried out:
      </p>
      <ol class="textformat">
        <li>
          It is verified that both the chamber door and the vacuum break valve are fully
          closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mechanical pump power supply is turned on (assuming the vacuum pump is
          functioning properly). Wait until the pressure in the main chamber reaches
          approximately \( 10^{-1} \) Torr.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, the turbomolecular pump is activated by pressing the lower-right button on
          the control panel. The pump frequency should increase until it reaches
          approximately 1500 Hz.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal is to reach the lowest pressure limit achievable by the turbomolecular
          pump, typically on the order of \( 10^{-8} \) Torr. However, in most cases, the base
          pressure is considered acceptable when below \( 5 \times 10^{-7} \) Torr.
